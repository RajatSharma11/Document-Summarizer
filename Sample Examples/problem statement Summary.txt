SUMMARY : 1  STATEMENT: The task is to devise and fabricate a manually controlled (wired/wireless) robot that can navigate through the estate  filled with hurdles and obstacles of varying difficulties.

Along with these hurdles the arena also includes undisclosed events and a lot of rough, slippery, moving inclined plains, rocky pathways and grabbing of objects(ball or rectangular boxes) which challenges the maneuverability of the  robot.

In case the robot topples, the robot will be placed at the previous check point.

The time taken to complete the first stage of the arena will be noted.

If at the end of 5 minutes, the bot is not  able to complete the stage, then the team will be disqualified.

The total weight of the robot and all the equipment and accessories including the power source should be no more than 3 kg.

However, the body of the bot can move with respect to the wheels) with the wheels still on ground.

Organisers will not be responsible for any alteration in the arena by the previous machines on the arena.

Any team that is not ready at the time specified will be removed from the competition automatically.

The machines would be checked for their consistency before the run and would be discarded if found inconsistent with  specifications.

Participants should not dismantle their robots before the completion of the whole competition as the machines might need to  be verified by the organisers at a later stage to ensure that the participants have not violated any of the rules.

The organisers reserve the right to change any or all of the above rules as they deem fit.
